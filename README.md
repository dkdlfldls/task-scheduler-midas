# task-scheduler-midas
Task Scheduler is a project conducted at the Hackathon at Midas IT in May 2016. </br>
This is a simple web application that helps schedule the events and tasks and share those with others. </br>
The topic itself was a subject of the Hackathon, and the team of three spent nearly 24 hours to bring out the result. <br/>

# Conductors
The team of three, Sungmin, engine, and Sanghoon divided the task and did their parts. Much thanks to all the members.
